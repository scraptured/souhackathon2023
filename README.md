# Southern Oregon University Hackathon 2023

This is a quick script I wrote that parses a text document of Shakespeare's sonnets into individual sonnets, lines, and words.

It then takes these parsed outputs and uses them to print out poems for the user to read.

The user has the choice between a real sonnet, a "sonnet" generated using a Markov model of the words, or a "sonnet" made by randomly mashing lines together.

The purpose of the program is pure play and fun. 

To run it, just download the repository and run the python script using python in the command line. Then, follow the prompts and enjoy! This was a lot of fun to create today. I hope you have fun with it too!
